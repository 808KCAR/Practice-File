<h1> This is my first page with GitHub Pages </h1>
  <p>I have created this website as part of an assignment with MIT. The course is Digital Transformation
  and I have already learned so much in this course designed for working professionals who wish to increase
  their current skillset. We as a team are learning about the innovating modern technologies that are shaping 
  our current landscape. I hope to fully understand the updates in our modern environment in order to help
  implement changes that will make my chosen industry more successful in an ever-increasingly competitive
  market. Digital transformation inlcludes studies in blockchain, cloud technology, cyber-security, the internet
  of things, and artificial intelligence. So far things are going well and I hope to understand the material 
  as much as possible. I feel like I am learning so much in such a short period of time. In turn this will make 
  me an asset as I help my organization push its boundaries towards the future. Wish me luck as I am only about
  half way there!!
Thanks GitHub!</p>
